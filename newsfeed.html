              <h3 class="newsTitle">$1.4m Banksy painting shredded at auction</h3>
              <h4 class="newsDate">Oct. 6, 2018, London</h4>
              <p>The British street artist Banksy pulled off one of his most spectacular pranks on Friday night, when
                one
                of
                his
                trademark paintings appeared to self-destruct at Sotheby’s in London after selling for $1.4 million at
                auction.
              </p><br>
              <p>The work, “Girl With Balloon,” a 2006 spray paint on canvas, was the last lot of Sotheby’s “Frieze
                Week”
                evening
                contemporary art sale. After competition between two telephone bidders, it was hammered down by the
                auctioneer
                Oliver Barker for 1 million pounds, more than three times the estimate and a new auction high for a
                work
                solely
                by the artist, according to Sotheby’s.
              </p><br>
              “Then we heard an alarm go off,” Morgan Long, the head of art investment at the London-based advisory
              firm
              Fine
              Art Group, who was sitting in the front row of the room, said in an interview on Saturday. “Everyone
              turned
              round, and the picture had slipped through its frame.”
              <p><br>
                The painting, mounted on a wall close to a row of Sotheby’s staff members, had been shredded, or at
                least
                partially shredded, by a remote-control mechanism on the back of the frame.</p>

              <h3 class="newsTitle">Banksy print reported stolen from Toronto exhibition</h3>
              <h4 class="newsDate">June 16, 2018, Toronto</h4>
              <p>A Banksy print is believed to have been stolen from an unauthorised exhibit of the street artist’s
                work
                in Canada.

                Toronto police, who are investigating the apparent robbery, said the print was taken out of the exhibit
                in the city’s west end on Sunday.

                Police learnt the piece had gone missing after they responded to a call over an alleged break-in at the
                site of the exhibition.</p><br>
              <p>They say the stolen print was called Trolley Hunter and valued at $35,000 (£26,000). It shows three
                crouching hunters – with one pointing a spear at a clustering of shopping carts.</p><br>

              <p>Police have released a video appearing to show the theft while the exhibition was still being set up.</p><br>

              <h3 class="newsTitle">Banksy unveils New York City mural protesting against Turkish artist Zehra Dogan’s
                imprisonment</h3>
              <h4 class="newsDate">March 16, 2018, New York</h4>
              <p>Banksy’s latest artwork has been unveiled; a New York-based mural dedicated to the Turkish artist
                Zehra Dogan, who was reportedly jailed for nearly three years over a painting.</p><br>

              <p>The anonymous British graffiti artist’s work features multiple black tally marks resembling jail bars,
                each representing a day Dogan has spent in prison. A rendering of Dogan appears behind one set, her
                left-hand bar changed into a pencil.</p><br>

              <p>The painting that led to Dogan’s imprisonment — depicting a destroyed Turkish city — was projected
                above the mural on the evening of March 15th.</p><br>
